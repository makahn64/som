# Speed of Light, Speed of Music

These are a variety of Android games that require 16 Android phones and 2+ Android tablets per installation. It was written for AT&T to use at brand events and was originally
a "clone" of the Speed of Light arcade game.

The app needed very fast network communication and relied on our custom UDP-based network protocol with automatic routing between devices. Super
phone, and not too easy to write :).

Speed of Music was an offshoot, also for AT&T. It was a kind of mixing turntable thingy where you picked beats and mixed in musical
snippets. The guest would then get emailed an MP3 of their music. It was a cool idea, but ended up not being that much fun to use...
